class HyperGCN(nn.Module):
    r"""
    HyperGCN approximates each hyperedge of the hypergraph by a set of pairwise edges connecting the vertices of the hyperedge
    and treats the learning problem as a graph learning problem on the approximation.
    Proposed in `HyperGCN: A New Method of Training Graph Convolutional Networks on Hypergraphs <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3454287.3454422>`_ paper (NeurIPS 2019).
    Reference implementation: `source <https://deephypergraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/dhg/models/hypergraphs/hypergcn.html#HyperGCN>`_.

    Args:
        in_channels: The number of input channels.
        hid_channels: The number of hidden channels.
        num_classes: The Number of classes of the classification task.
        use_batch_normalization: If set to ``True``, layers will use batch normalization. Defaults to ``False``.
        drop_rate: Dropout ratio. Defaults to ``0.5``.
        use_mediator: Whether to use mediator to transform the hyperedges to edges in the graph. Defaults to ``False``.
        fast: If set to True, the transformed graph structure will be computed once from the input hypergraph and vertex features, and cached for future use. Defaults to ``True``.
