        This function combines multiple separate hypergraph samples into a single
        batched representation suitable for mini-batch training. It handles:
        - Concatenating node features from all samples
        - Concatenating and offsetting hyperedge from all samples
        - Concatenating edge attributes from all samples, if present

        Example:
            Given batch = [HData_0, HData_1].

            For node features:
                HData_0.x.shape = (3, 64) # 3 nodes with 64 features
                HData_1.x.shape = (2, 64) # 2 nodes with 64 features

                The output will be HData with:
                    x.shape = (5, 64) # All 5 nodes concatenated

                HData_1 (2 nodes, 1 hyperedge):
                    hyperedge_index = [[0, 1], # Nodes 0, 1
                                  [0, 0]] # Hyperedge 0 contains {0,1}
